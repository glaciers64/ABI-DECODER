# ABI-Decoder
This script provides contract ABI by it's address.

## Recommendation before use

# üî•üî• PYTHON version must be 3.10 üî•üî•
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **version 3.10**

## Installation
You can download [**Repository**](https://github.com/glaciers64/ABI-DECODER.git) by cloning it to your system and installing the necessary dependencies:
```shell
~ >>> git clone https://github.com/glaciers64/ABI-DECODER.git
~ >>> cd ABI-DECODER

#Linux
~/ABI-DECODER >>> python3 -m venv venv
~/ABI-DECODER >>> source venv/bin/activate
~/ABI-DECODER >>> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~/ABI-DECODER >>> python3 main.py

#Windows
~/ABI-DECODER >>> python -m venv venv
~/ABI-DECODER >>> venv\Scripts\activate
~/ABI-DECODER >>> pip install -r requirements.txt
